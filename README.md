# Lumix Voice Memo Aggregator
**Lumix Voice Memo Aggregator** is a Python script designed to aggregate all `.MOV` files generated by the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 camera's voice memo function into a single, concatenated video. This tool simplifies the process of managing and reviewing voice-enhanced photos by automating the video compilation.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection:** Scans a specified source folder for `.MOV` files.
- **Chronological Sorting:** Sorts videos based on their modification date to maintain the correct sequence.
- **Video Concatenation:** Merges multiple video clips into a single output file with audio preserved.
- **Flexible Output:** Allows customization of the output filename and destination folder.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors during video loading and exporting.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easily specify source and destination folders, as well as output filenames via command-line arguments.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **moviepy** library

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marc-alexis-com/lumix-voice-memo-aggregator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd lumix-voice-memo-aggregator
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Then install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install moviepy
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

The script can be run from the command line, allowing you to specify the source and destination folders, as well as the output filename.

**Syntax:**

```bash
python aggregate_videos.py <source_folder> <destination_folder> [--output OUTPUT_FILENAME]
```

**Parameters:**

- `<source_folder>`: Path to the folder containing `.MOV` files.
- `<destination_folder>`: Path to the folder where the concatenated video will be saved.
- `--output OUTPUT_FILENAME` *(optional)*: Name of the output video file. Defaults to `output_video.mp4`.

**Example:**

```bash
python aggregate_videos.py "/Users/username/LumixVideos" "/Users/username/FinalVideo" --output "combined_voice_memo.mp4"
```

### Script Configuration

If you prefer to set the source and destination folders directly in the script:

1. Open `aggregate_videos.py` in a text editor.
2. Set the `source_folder` and `destination_folder` variables accordingly.

```python
source_folder = "/path/to/source"
destination_folder = "/path/to/destination"
output_filename = "output_video.mp4"
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python aggregate_videos.py
```

## Example Output

After running the script, you will find a single `.mp4` file in your specified destination folder that combines all the `.MOV` files from the source folder in chronological order, complete with their associated voice memos.
